The league is presented with a more personalized approach that offers amenities seldom used in recreational sports leagues today. We look to integrate social media in order to provide real time scores, complete stats, schedules and league information through various channels, virtually keeping you connected to what is going on in the league, at a moments notice. Player profiles and history will give you an opportunity to interact and meet with new players and people. The primary goal of HUB is to create and promote an enjoyable environment to participate, in which Teams, Players and Fans can feel a sense of Community and Belonging. </p>
